# Parallel DNA Sequence Analysis using OpenMP

Each file in this repository is designed to process large gene datasets and perform parallel DNA analysis using OpenMP. The code was completed as part of a class project in Parallel, Distributed, and Network programming - and is meant to showcase the capabilities of parallel programming techniques to accelerate large tasks.
